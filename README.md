Welcome to the Appointment Web Application!

This project showcases a unique platform where users can book appointments with their favorite celebrities/influencers online. With two distinct login sections for clients and users, it offers a seamless experience for both parties involved.

Key Features:
1. Appointment Booking: Users can easily schedule appointments with their desired celebrities/influencers through a user-friendly interface.
2. Dual Login System: The application provides separate login sections for clients and users, ensuring a personalized experience for each category.
3. Notification System: Users receive instant notifications on the website to confirm their appointment bookings, keeping them informed and updated.

We have implemented best practices using React.js for building responsive UI components, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. The backend is powered by NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB for the dataBase, enabling efficient data management and secure authentication.
